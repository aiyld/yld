Last night, my parents drove from Zhongshan to Shenzhen after handling the business. They arrived at about 7 o'clock. Then my mother started preparing dinner for us without a break.

An hour later,  we started the dinner. That was a rare family dinner. Because we live far from our parents, we can’t get together often. And my parents are always busy with business matters.

After dinner, I advised them not to go back to Zhongshan and stay for a night. They finally agreed after I persuaded it for a long time.


My wife is pregnant, she sometimes complains that my parents can't take care of her. But I know that my parents are involuntarily. They are very hard. I understand their situation very well.

This is the family thing.
